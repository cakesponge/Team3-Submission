        <h2>What is International Humanitarian Law?</h2>

        <p>
            When humans go into war, they don't want civilians getting hurt. </br>International 
            Humanitarian Law is a series of laws put in place </br>to prevent civilians from getting 
            harmed by the impacts of war. </br>These human rights laws are an extension of 
            international law, </br>and are applied by almost every country.

        <h2>The History of International Humanitarian Law</h2> 
        <img src="Pen.png" alt="penandpaper" style="width:300; height:300; float:left; padding: 30px;">
        <p style="text-align:right;">
            The International Humanitarian Law first appeared in the 1870s </br>as the product of work 
            done by various actors pursing different ends. </br>The actual law was implemented in 1949
            in the Geneva Conventions. </br>Eventhough this law was there, not many people followed it.
            </br>Near the end of the 20th century, international lawyers </br>decided to look into this problem
            of the human right organizations. </br>The International Humanitarian Law is not only used in </br>Genava
            but it is used everywhere, it is international.
